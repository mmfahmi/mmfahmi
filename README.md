ðŸ‘¤ About Me
Fahmi mm (@mmfahmi)
Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence Researcher focused on scam/phishing detection, OSINT, and automation. I build sandboxed analysis tools and intelligence pipelines to uncover and mitigate scam campaigns.

ðŸ”§ Technical Expertise:
Scam & URL Threat Analysis â€” Deep metadata extraction (WHOIS, DNS, headers), YARA-based detection, and HTML/JavaScript risk scoring.

Browser Stealth Automation â€” Playwright-based scraping with advanced fingerprinting to bypass bot detection systems (e.g. Cloudflare, Imperva).

Security-Sandboxed Deployment â€” Tools run inside Docker containers with nonâ€‘root permissions, isolated runtimes, rate limiting, and hardened configurations.

API + CLI Interfaces â€” FastAPI-powered REST APIs (with Swagger docs), batch processing, and interactive CLI clients.

Cloud & CI/CD Integration â€” Automated GitHub Actions pipelines to deploy tools on GCP (Cloud Run, VM, GKE) with autoscaling and HTTPS support.

ðŸš€ Highlight Project:
urlâ€‘analyzer â€” A robust sandbox to analyze suspicious URLs. Combines metadata scraping, Playwright fallback, batch input processing, and YARA rule scanning to detect threatsâ€”designed for secure, scalable deployment via Docker and GCP. CLI and API access supported.
